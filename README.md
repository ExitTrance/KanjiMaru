# KanjiMaru

Not in development anymore for reasons I shall not state here. Still loved the design I created, so it will stay up.
----



Flashcard and Japanese Characters writing mobile application made in Flutter. Still a work in progress! 

As I have been frustrated by the fact that apps on the market do not provide a 'good' way to learn to write Japanese Characters, I have decided to create my own app.  

Inspired by both Anki and WaniKani, tools which I still use at the moment on my Japanese learning journey. While they are great tools, I have been wanting to create something of my own for a while.

## Where does the name come KanjiMaru come from?
It comes from an adorable fluff ball named Maru. The reason I remember the Kanji 'ä¸¸'.
